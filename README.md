# isfunc.c
an isfunc(void *p) function that returns true if *p is a function


So far only tested on a 64bit intel runing ubuntu15.  But it should work on any linux or OSx system.  For windows probably needs some slight modifications, but hey the program is like 30 lines long so should not be difficult.

simple clone or download/unzip and:

$ make

$ sudo make install # optional, but then you need to copy the header and library file

$ make test
